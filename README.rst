cfncluster
==========

cfncluster is a framework that deploys and maintains HPC clusters on AWS. It is reasonably agnostic to what the cluster is for and can easily be extended to support different frameworks. The CLI is stateless, everything is done using CloudFormation or resources within AWS.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is part of the project and is published to - http://cfncluster.readthedocs.org/. Of most interest to new users is the Getting Started Guide - http://cfncluster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html.
