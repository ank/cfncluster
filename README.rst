cfncluster
==========

CfnCluster ("cloud formation cluster") is a framework that deploys and maintains high performance computing clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Developed by AWS, CfnCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and production deployments. CfnCluster supports many different types of clustered applications and can easily be extended to support different frameworks. The CLI is stateless, everything is done using CloudFormation or resources within AWS.
